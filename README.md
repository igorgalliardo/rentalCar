# rentalCar
Simple system that allow a business to create a customer list, a car list and then rent some car for a specific customer

To be able to rent a car for some customer you have to check if this car and also this customer are already inside of your database. If not, you need to create a new register to each one.

Once that you are able to see your customer and the respective car that he would like to rent, you can create a new rent for your customer.
